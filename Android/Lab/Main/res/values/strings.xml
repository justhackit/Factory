 To use DroidStats you should configure how much "<b>free minutes, free sms and free data</b>" is included with your plan. If you don't have limits you can set your "<b>personal limits</b>" to save costs. If you reach limits you will get notified and the progress bars gets colored orange and red.

 There are four different tabs, the first tab is the overview, which provides you with compact information about the current month. The other tabs give you detailed information about every service (Calls, SMS, Data). You can click on each statistic in that lists to get more informations. In the calls and SMS view you can click on the contact photos in the top lists to use "<b>QuickActions</b>".

 For a better and faster control over your month, try the widgets. There are 3 different widgets, the biggest one of them also shows you your data limit.

 Please don't forget to adjust your "<b>billing increment</b> to that of your provider. You can also set the <b>first day of the month</b> when your bill starts. This app <b>emulates the behaviour</b>" of your provider, but it isn't possible to adjust to all kinds of plans. It is not possible to determine to what provider you are calling. This data has ONLY your provider. If you have "<b>free numbers you can exclude</b>" them in the options.

 DroidStats syncs your SMS in/outbox and your call log with an own event log. Don't care about the Androids internal 500 calls limit and about deleted SMS and calls, they will be counted also after DroidStats is installed to improve the quality of the counters. There is no warranty on the calculated data.s

 If you own a "<b>slower device</b> like a HTC Dream, HTC Magic or HTC Hero please disable the animations in the options of DroidStats to fasten up the app. Please <b>"don't use Task Killers"</b>" to kill DroidStats.

 Bear in mind that the first month of measuring starts with installing this app.

 You can find my email address in the about and contact me if you have questions or find bugs
